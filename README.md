Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data. Unlike traditional neural networks, which assume inputs are independent of each other, RNNs use loops within their architecture to retain information from previous inputs. This makes them well-suited for problems where context and order matter.

How RNNs Work

RNNs process sequential data one step at a time, passing information from one step to the next through a hidden state.

This hidden state acts as a memory, enabling the network to capture dependencies across time steps.

The same set of weights is applied at each time step, making RNNs efficient and capable of handling variable-length sequences.

Strengths

Can model sequential and time-series data.

Useful for tasks where past context influences the current outcome.

Handles variable-length input sequences naturally.

Limitations

Standard RNNs struggle with long-term dependencies due to issues like vanishing and exploding gradients.

More advanced architectures such as LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units) were developed to overcome these challenges.

Applications

Natural Language Processing (NLP): text generation, sentiment analysis, machine translation.

Speech Recognition: converting spoken language into text.

Time-Series Forecasting: predicting stock prices, weather trends, or sales.

Sequence Prediction: identifying patterns in DNA sequences or other ordered data.
